# Exercise 3 - Review session

In this exercise we'll look at the way we've been working together!

Maybe you've tried doing a code review?

:book: A code review is a process where two or more developers visually inspect a set of program code, typically, several times. The code can be a method, a class, or an entire program. The main code-review objectives are:

* Best Practice ~ A more efficient, less error-prone, or more elegant way to accomplish a given task.<br/>
* Error Detection ~ Discovering logical or transitional errors.

You've now tried to pair with at least one person and tried at least two katas. Go through how you found the pairing session with your last partner. Spend about 10 minutes on this exercise. For those who want, we'll do a short summary with the rest of the participants. 

* Did you manage to divide the work evenly? If not, what could you as a pair have done to improve?
* When you were observing, could you follow what the driver was thinking? How did you interact?
* When you were driving, what did you do to include the observer?
* What did you think of the code that came out of this exercise? How is it different from what you would have written on your own? 
* How did you communicate? Did you manage to be polite and professional? Were you offered the keyboard when you had an idea?

If you're up for a challange, give exercise 4 a shot:
