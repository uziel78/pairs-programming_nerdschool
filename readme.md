## Focus of this workshop

The focus of this workshop is to teach you how to program in pairs effectively.

## What you need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## How to get started

- Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
- Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises organized in folders. Each folder contains a `README.md` describing the exercise:

- [Exercise 1 - Pomodoro-style pairing](exercise-1/) (start here)
- [Exercise 2 - Test/method-style pairing - New pairs](exercise-2/)
- [Exercise 3 - Code review](exercise-3/)
- [Exercise 4 - Roman numerals](exercise-4/)

Exercise 1-3 is the main content in this workshop, while exercise 4 is an optional challange

### Symbols and notation used in exercises

#### Icons with special meaning

:pencil2: - A task you should do  
:book: - A section of text to read (no tasks, just information).  
:bulb: - Additional information.  
:exclamation: - Something important.  
:question: - Open-ended question for the reader ("What do you think would happen if...")  
:poop: - Bad practice (don't-do-this)  
:star: - A bonus task (not required)  

#### Keyboard keys

Will look like this:
