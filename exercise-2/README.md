# Exercise 2 - Test/method-style pairing

This exercise will focus on test/method-style pairing pairing using the fizz buzz kata from the last exercise.

## 2.1 Pair programming session

> :exclamation: **Session length:**  2 x 15 minutes

:pencil2: Run through the Fizz buzz kata in pairs like the last exercise, but this time in _new pairs_.

:pencil2: Use test/method-paring: One person writes the test, the other writes the implementation code. Both should discuss.

:pencil2: Rotate half-way, so that the driver becomes the observer for the last 15 minutes.
